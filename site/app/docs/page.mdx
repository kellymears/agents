# Documentation

Welcome to the Claude Config documentation. This guide covers setup, configuration, and usage of the custom commands and skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- Git configured with SSH access
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for PR creation

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kellymears/claude.git
```

Then copy the `.claude` directory to your project or use it as a reference.

## Configuration Files

### settings.local.json

Local permission overrides for Claude Code. This file controls what actions Claude can take without asking for confirmation.

### commands/

Custom slash commands that extend Claude Code's functionality. Each command is defined in a markdown file that describes its behavior.

## Writing Custom Commands

Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# Command Name

Description of what the command does.

## Usage

How to use the command.
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep commands focused** - Each command should do one thing well
- **Document thoroughly** - Clear descriptions help Claude understand intent
- **Test incrementally** - Build up complex workflows step by step
